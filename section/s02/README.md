# Section 02: Testing

Is week we will cover testing. here are some resources you might find
helpful:

- [Testing (R packages)](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html)
- [`testthat` paper](http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-1/RJournal_2011-1_Wickham.pdf)

Some of the technical details (such as `nchar`'s functionality) in the first paper is a bit outdated, 
but the core philosophy on unit testing are still solid.

We will also work through a contrived example with the quadratic formula.
