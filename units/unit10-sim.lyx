\begin_layout Standard
Many (most?) statistical papers include a simulation (i.e., Monte Carlo) study.
 The basic idea is that closed-form analysis of the properties of a statistical
 method/model is often hard to do.
 Even if possible, it usually involves approximations or simplifications.
 A canonical situation is that we have an asymptotic result and we want
 to know what happens in finite samples, but often we do not even have the
 asymptotic result.
 Instead, we can estimate mathematical expressions using random numbers.
 So we design a simulation study to evaluate the method/model or compare
 multiple methods.
 The result is that the statistician carries out an experiment, generally
 varying different factors to see what has an effect on the outcome of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic strategy generally involves simulating data and then using the
 method(s) on the simulated data, summarizing the results to assess/compare
 the method(s).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most simulation studies aim to approximate an integral, generally an expected
 value (mean, bias, variance, MSE, probability, etc.).
 In low dimensions, methods such as Gaussian quadrature are best for estimating
 an integral but these methods don't scale well (we'll discuss this in Unit
 12 on integration/differentiation), so in higher dimensions we often use
 Monte Carlo techniques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be more concrete, if we have a 
\emph on
method for doing a hypothesis test
\emph default
, what criteria would we use to assess the hypothesis test? What properties
 do we want the test to have?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or if we have a 
\emph on
method for estimating a model parameter
\emph default
 (including uncertainty), such as a regression coefficient, what properties
 do we want the method to have and what criteria could we use?

Or if we have a 
\emph on
prediction method
\emph default
 (including prediction uncertainty), what properties do we want the method

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Monte Carlo considerations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Motivating example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose we've come up with a fabulous new estimator for the mean of a distributi
on.
 The estimator is to take the middle value of the sorted observations as
 our estimate of the mean of the entire distribution.
 We work out some theory to show that this estimator is robust to outlying
 observations and we come up with a snazzy new name for our estimator.
 We call it the 'median'.
 Let's denote it as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{X}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, we have no good way of estimating 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Var}(\tilde{X})=E((\tilde{X}-E(\tilde{X}))^{2})$
\end_inset

 analytically.
 We decide to use a Monte Carlo estimate 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\tilde{X}_{i}-\bar{\tilde{X}})^{2}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\tilde{X}}=\frac{1}{m}\sum\tilde{X}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Each 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{X}_{i}$
\end_inset

 in this case is generated by generating a dataset and calculating the median.
 In evaluating the variance of the median and comparing it to our standard
 estimator, the sample mean, what decisions do we have to make in our Monte
 Carlo procedure?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next let's think about Monte Carlo methods in general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Monte Carlo basics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic idea is that we often want to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\equiv E_{f}(h(X))$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $X\sim f$
\end_inset

.
 Note that if 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is an indicator function, this includes estimation of probabilities, e.g.,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p=P(X\leq x)=F(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{x}f(t)dt=\int I(t\leq x)f(t)dt=E_{f}(I(X\leq x))$
\end_inset

.
 We would estimate variances or MSEs by having 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 involve squared terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We get an MC estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 based on an iid sample of a large number of values of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\phi}=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}h(X_{i}),
\]

\end_inset

which is justified by the Law of Large Numbers.
 The simulation variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\phi}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Var}(\hat{\phi})=\sigma^{2}/m$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}=\mbox{Var}(h(X))$
\end_inset

.
 An estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}=E_{f}((h(X)-\phi)^{2})$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\sigma}^{2}=\frac{1}{m-1}\sum(h(X_{i})-\hat{\phi})^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 So our MC simulation error is based on 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{\mbox{Var}}(\hat{\phi})=\frac{1}{m(m-1)}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h(X_{i})-\hat{\phi})^{2}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes the 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

 are generated in a dependent fashion (e.g., sequential MC or MCMC), in which
 case this variance estimator does not hold because the samples are not
 IID, but the estimator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is still correct.
 [As a sidenote, a common misperception with MCMC is that you should thin
 your chains because of dependence of the samples.
 This is not correct - the only reason to thin a chain is if you want to
 save on computer storage or processing.]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that in this case the randomness in the system is very well-defined
 (as it is in survey sampling, but unlike in most other applications of
 statistics), because it comes from the RNG that we perform as part of our
 attempt to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Happily, we are in control of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, so in principle we can reduce the simulation error to as little as we
 desire.
 Unhappily, as usual, the standard error goes down with the square root
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Subsection
Variance reduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some tools for variance reduction in MC settings.
 One is importance sampling (see Section 3).
 Others are the use of control variates and antithetic sampling.
 I haven't personally run across these latter in practice, so I'm not sure
 how widely used they are and won't go into them here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some cases we can set up natural strata, for which we know the probability
 of being in each stratum.
 Then we would estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 for each stratum and combine the estimates based on the probabilities.
 The intuition is that we remove the variability in sampling amongst the
 strata from our simulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another strategy that comes up in MCMC contexts is 
\emph on
Rao-Blackwellization
\emph default
.
 Suppose we want to know 
\begin_inset Formula $E(h(X))$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $X=\{X_{1},X_{2}\}$
\end_inset

.
 Iterated expectation tells us that 
\begin_inset Formula $E(h(X))=E(E(h(X)|X_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 If we can compute 
\begin_inset Formula $E(h(X)|X_{2})=\int h(x_{1},x_{2})f(x_{1}|x_{2})dx_{1}$
\end_inset

 then we should avoid introducing stochasticity related to the 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}$
\end_inset

 draw (since we can analytically integrate over that) and only average over
 stochasticity from the 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

 draw by estimating 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{X_{2}}(E(h(X)|X_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 The estimator is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\mu}_{RB}=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}E(h(X)|X_{2,i})
\]

\end_inset

where we either draw from the marginal distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

, or equivalently, draw 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, but only use 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Our MC estimator averages over the simulated values of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 This is called Rao-Blackwellization because it relates to the idea of condition
ing on a sufficient statistic.
 It has lower variance because the variance of each term in the sum of the
 Rao-Blackwellized estimator is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Var}(E(h(X)|X_{2})$
\end_inset

, which is less than the variance in the usual MC estimator, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Var}(h(X))$
\end_inset

, based on the usual iterated variance formula: 
\begin_inset Formula $V(X)=E(V(X|Y))+V(E(X|Y))\Rightarrow V(E(X|Y))<V(X)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Design of simulation studies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's pose a concrete example.
 This is based on a JASA paper that you looked at for PS6.
 Suppose one is modeling data as being from a mixture of normal distributions:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(y;\theta)=\sum_{j=1}^{k}w_{i}f(y;\mu_{j},\sigma_{j})
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $f(y;\mu_{j},\sigma_{j})$
\end_inset

 is a normal density with mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{j}$
\end_inset

 and s.d.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\{\mu_{1},\ldots,\mu_{k},\sigma_{1},\ldots,\sigma_{k}\}$
\end_inset

.
 A statistician has developed methodology for carrying out a hypothesis
 test for 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}:\,k=k_{0}$
\end_inset

 vs.
 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{a}:\,k>k_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, what are the key issues that need to be assessed to evaluate their
 methodology? What do we want to know to assess a hypothesis test?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, what do we need to consider in carrying out a simulation study to
 address those issues?

Specify what makes up an individual experiment (i.e..
 individual simulated dataset) given a specific set of inputs: sample size,
 distribution(s) to use, parameter values, statistic of interest, etc.
 In other words, exactly how would you generate one simulated dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Often you'll want to see how your results will vary if you change some of
 the inputs; e.g., sample sizes, parameter values, data generating mechanisms.
 So determine what factors you'll want to vary.
 Each unique combination of input values will be a scenario.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Write code to carry out the individual experiment and return the quantity
 of interest, with arguments to your code being the inputs that you want
 to vary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For each combination of inputs you want to explore (each scenario), repeat
 the experiment 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 times.
 Note this is an embarrassingly parallel calculation (in both the data generatin
g dimension and the inputs dimension(s).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Report the results in graphical or tabular form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often a simulation study will compare multiple methods, so you'll need to
 do steps 3-6 for each method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since a simulation study is an experiment, we should use the same principles
 of design and analysis we would recommend when advising a practicioner
 on setting up a scientific experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These include efficiency, reporting of uncertainty, reproducibility and
 documentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In generating the data for a simulation study, we want to think about what
 structure real data would have that we want to mimic in the simulation
 study: distributional assumptions, parameter values, dependence structure,
 outliers, random effects, sample size (
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

), etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these may become input variables in a simulation study.
 Often we compare two or more statistical methods conditioning on the data
 context and then assess whether the differences between methods vary with
 the data context choices.
 E.g., if we compare an MLE to a robust estimator, which is better under a
 given set of choices about the data generating mechanism and how sensitive
 is the comparison to changing the features of the data generating mechanism?
 So the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

treatment variable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the choice of statistical method.
 We're then interested in sensitivity to the conditions (different input
 values).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often we can have a large number of replicates (
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

) because the simulation is fast on a computer, so we can sometimes reduce
 the simulation error to essentially zero and thereby avoid reporting uncertaint
y.
 To do this, we need to calculate the simulation standard error, generally,
 
\begin_inset Formula $s/\sqrt{m}$
\end_inset

 and see how it compares to the effect sizes.
 This is particularly important when reporting on the bias of a statistical
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We might denote the data, which could be the statistical estimator under
 each of two methods as 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{ijklq}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 indexes treatment, 
\begin_inset Formula $j,k,l$
\end_inset

 index different additional input variables, and 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in\{1,\ldots,m\}$
\end_inset

 indexes the replicate.
 E.g., 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 might index whether the data are from a t or normal, 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 the value of a parameter, and 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 the dataset sample size (i.e., different levels of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can think about choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 based on a basic power calculation, though since we can always generate
 more replicates, one might just proceed sequentially and stop when the
 precision of the results is sufficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When comparing methods, it's best to use the same simulated datasets for
 each level of the treatment variable and to do an analysis that controls
 for the dataset (i.e., for the random numbers used), thereby removing some
 variability from the error term.
 A simple example is to do a paired analysis, where we look at differences
 between the outcome for two statistical methods, pairing based on the simulated
 dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can even use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

same
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 random number generation for the replicates under different conditions.
 E.g., in assessing sensitivity to a 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 vs.
 normal data generating mechanism, we might generate the normal RVs and
 then for the 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 use the same random numbers, in the sense of using the same quantiles of
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 as were generated for the normal - this is pretty easy, as seen below.
 This helps to control for random differences between the datasets.

\begin_layout Subsection
Experimental Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A typical context is that one wants to know the effect of multiple input
 variables on some outcome.
 Often, scientists, and even statisticians doing simulation studies will
 vary one input variable at a time.
 As we know from standard experimental design, this is inefficient.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We may have a focal variable and other variables that can be considered
 blocking variables - they have an effect on the outcome but are not of
 substantive interest, so we vary the focal variable within fixed levels
 of the blocking variables.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard strategy is to discretize the inputs, each into a small number
 of levels.
 If we have a small enough number of inputs and of levels, we can do a full
 factorial design (potentially with replication).
 For example if we have three inputs and three levels each, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $3^{3}$
\end_inset

 different treatment combinations.
 Choosing the levels in a reasonable way is obviously important.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the number of inputs and/or levels increases to the point that we can't
 carry out the full factorial, a fractional factorial is an option.
 This carefully chooses which treatment combinations to omit.
 The goal is to achieve balance across the levels in a way that allows us
 to estimate lower level effects (in particular main effects) but not all
 high-order interactions.
 What happens is that high-order interactions are aliased to (confounded
 with) lower-order effects.
 For example you might choose a fractional factorial design so that you
 can estimate main effects and two-way interactions but not higher-order
 interactions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In interpreting the results, I suggest focusing on the decomposition of
 sums of squares and not on statistical significance.
 In most cases, we expect the inputs to have at least some effect on the
 outcome, so the null hypothesis is a straw man.
 Better to assess the magnitude of the impacts of the different inputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When one has a very large number of inputs, one can use the Latin hypercube
 approach to sample in the input space in a uniform way, spreading the points
 out so that each input is sampled uniformly.
 Assume that each input is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{U}(0,1)$
\end_inset

 (one can easily transform to whatever marginal distributions you want).
 Suppose that you can run 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 samples.
 Then for each input variable, we divide the unit interval into 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 bins and randomly choose the order of bins and the position within each
 bin.
 This is done independently for each variable and then combined to give
 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 samples from the input space.
 We would then analyze main effects and perhaps two-way interactions to
 assess which inputs seem to be most important.

Computational efficiency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parallel processing is often helpful for simulation studies.
 The reason is that simulation studies are embarrassingly parallel - we
 can send each replicate to a different computer processor and then collect
 the results back, and the speedup should scale directly with the number
 of processors we used.
 Since we often need to some sort of looping, writing code in C/C++ and
 compiling and linking to the code from R may also be a good strategy, albeit
 one not covered in this course.

Analysis and reporting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often results are reported simply in tables, but it can be helpful to think
 through whether a graphical representation is more informative (sometimes
 it's not or it's worse, but in some cases it may be much better).
 Since you'll often have a variety of scenarios to display, using trellis
 plots in ggplot2 via the 
\emph on
facet_wrap
\emph default
 function will often be a good approach to display how results vary as a
 function of multiple inputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should set the seed when you start the experiment, so that it's possible
 to replicate it.
 It's also a good idea to save the current value of the seed whenever you
 save interim results, so that you can restart simulations (this is particularly
 helpful for MCMC) at the exact point you left off, including the random
 number sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To enhance reproducibility, it's good practice to post your simulation code

Random number generation (RNG)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the core of simulations is the ability to generate random numbers, and
 based on that, random variables.
 On a computer, our goal is to generate sequences of pseudo-random numbers
 that behave like random numbers but are replicable.
 The reason that replicability is important is so that we can reproduce
 the simulation.

Generating random uniforms on a computer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generating a sequence of random standard uniforms is the basis for all generatio
n of random variables, since random uniforms (either a single one or more
 than one) can be used to generate values from other distributions.
 Most random numbers on a computer are pseudo-random.
 The numbers are chosen from a deterministic stream of numbers that behave
 like random numbers but are actually a finite sequence (recall that both
 integers and real numbers on a computer are actually discrete and there
 are finitely many distinct values), so it's actually possible to get repeats.
 The seed of a RNG is the place within that sequence where you start to
 use the pseudo-random numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many RNG methods are sequential congruential methods.
 The basic idea is that the next value is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{k}=f(u_{k-1},\ldots,u_{k-j})\mbox{mod}\,m
\]

\end_inset

for some function, 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, and some positive integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 just means to take the remainder after dividing by 
\begin_inset Formula $m$

.
 One then generates the random standard uniform value as 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}/m$
\end_inset

, which by construction is in 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the construction, such sequences are periodic if the subsequence ever
 reappears, which is of course guaranteed because there is a finite number
 of possible values given that all the values are remainders of divisions
 by a fixed number

 One key to a good random number generator (RNG) is to have a very long
 period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example of a sequential congruential method is a basic linear congruential
 generator:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{k}=(au_{k-1})\mbox{mod}\,m
\]

\end_inset

with integer 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

 values.
 Here the periodicity can't exceed 
\begin_inset Formula $m-1$
\end_inset

 (the method is set up so that we never get 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}=0$
\end_inset

 as this causes the algorithm to break), so we only have 
\begin_inset Formula $m-1$
\end_inset

 possible values.
 The seed is the initial state, 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{0}$
\end_inset

 - i.e., the point in the sequence at which we start.
 By setting the seed you guarantee reproducibility since given a starting
 value, the sequence is deterministic.
 In general 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 are chosen to be large, but of course they can't be too large if they are
 to be represented as computer integers.
 The standard values of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 are Mersenne primes, which have the form 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{p}-1$
\end_inset

 (but these are not prime for all 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

), with 
\begin_inset Formula $m=2^{31}-1$
\end_inset

 common.

\begin_layout Standard
A wide variety of different RNG have been proposed.
 Many have turned out to have substantial defects based on tests designed
 to assess if the behavior of the RNG mimics true randomness.
 Some of the behavior we want to ensure is uniformity of each individual
 random deviate, independence of sequences of deviates, and multivariate
 uniformity of subsequences.
 One test of a RNG that many RNGs don't perform well on is to assess the
 properties of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-tuples - subsequences of length 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, which should be independently distributed in the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-dimensional unit hypercube.
 Unfortunately, linear congruential methods produce values that lie on a
 simple lattice in 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-space, i.e., the points are not selected from 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{k}$
\end_inset

 uniformly spaced points, where 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is the the number of unique values.
 Instead, points often lie on parallel lines in the hypercube.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Combining generators can yield better generators.
 The Wichmann-Hill is an option in R and is a combination of three linear
 congruential generators with 
\begin_inset Formula $a=\{171,172,170\}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $m=\{30269,30307,30323\}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}=(x_{i}/30269+y_{i}/30307+z_{i}/30323)\mbox{mod}\,1$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 are generated from the three individual generators.

\begin_layout Standard
By default R uses something called the Mersenne twister, which is in the
 class of generalized feedback shift registers (GFSR).
 The basic idea of a GFSR is to come up with a deterministic generator of
 bits (i.e., a way to generate sequences of 0s and 1s), 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,2,3,\ldots$
\end_inset

.
 The pseudo-random numbers are then determined as sequential subsequences
 of length 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\{B_{i}\}$
\end_inset

, considered as a base-2 number and dividing by 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{L}$
\end_inset

 to get a number in 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,1)$
\end_inset

.
 In general the sequence of bits is generated by taking 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{i}$
\end_inset

 to be the 
\emph on
exclusive or
\emph default
 [i.e., 0+0 = 0; 0 + 1 = 1; 1 + 0 = 1; 1 + 1 = 0] summation of two previous
 bits further back in the sequence where the lengths of the lags are carefully
 chosen.

\begin_layout Subsection
RNG in R
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can change the RNG in R using 
\emph on
RNGkind()
\emph default
.
 We can set the seed with 
\emph on
set.seed()
\emph default
.
 The seed is stored in 
\emph on
.Random.seed
\emph default
.
 The first element indicates the type of RNG (and the type of normal RV
 generator).
 The remaining values are specific to the RNG.
 In the demo code, we've seen that for Wichmann-Hill, the remaining three
 numbers are the current values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x,y,z\}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In R the default RNG is the Mersenne twister (
\family typewriter
?RNGkind
\family default
), which is considered to be state-of-the-art -- it has some theoretical
 support, has performed reasonably on standard tests of pseudorandom numbers
 and has been used without evidence of serious failure.
 Plus it's fast (because bitwise operations are fast).
 In fact this points out one of the nice features of R, which is that for
 something as important as this, the default is generally carefully chosen
 by R's developers.
 The particular Mersenne twister used has a periodicity of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{19937}-1\approx10^{6000}$
\end_inset

.
 Practically speaking this means that if we generated one random uniform
 per nanosecond for 10 billion years, then we would generate 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{25}$
\end_inset

 numbers, well short of the period.
 So we don't need to worry about the periodicity! The seed for the Mersenne
 twister is a set of 624 32-bit integers plus a position in the set, where
 the position is 
\family typewriter
.Random.seed[2]
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can set the seed by passing an integer to 
\emph on
set.seed()
\emph default
, which then sets as many actual seeds as required for a given generator.
 Here I'll refer to the integer passed to 
\emph on
set.seed()
\emph default
 as 
\emph on
the
\emph default
 seed.
 Ideally, nearby seeds generally should not correspond to getting sequences
 from the stream that are closer to each other than far away seeds.
 According to Gentle (CS, p.
 327) the input to 
\emph on
set.seed()
\emph default
 should be an integer, 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in\{0,\ldots,1023\}$
\end_inset

 , and each of these 1024 values produces positions in the RNG sequence
 that are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

far away
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from each other.
 I don't see any mention of this in the R documentation for 
\emph on
set.seed()
\emph default
 and furthermore, you can pass integers larger than 1023 to 
\emph on
set.seed()
\emph default
, so I'm not sure how much to trust Gentle's claim.
 More on generating parallel streams of random numbers below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we get replicability by setting the seed to a specific value at the beginning
 of our simulation.
 We can then set the seed to that same value when we want to replicate the
 simulation.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RNGs in R generally return 32-bit (4-byte) integers converted to doubles,
 so there are at most 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{32}$
\end_inset

 distinct values.
 This means you could get duplicated values in long runs, but this does
 not violate the comment about the periodicity because the two values after
 the two duplicated numbers will not be duplicates of each other -- note
 there is a distinction between the values as presented to the user and
 the values as generated by the RNG algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to proceed if you're using both R and C is to have C use the R RNG,
 calling the C functions that R uses under the hood, which are located in
 the 
\emph on
Rmath
\emph default
 library.
 This way you have a consistent source of random numbers and don't need
 to worry about issues with RNG in C.
 If you call C from R, this should approach should also work (see details
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/cpp"
target "http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/cpp"

\end_inset

); you could also generate all the random numbers you need in R and pass
 them to the C function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that whenever a random number is generated, the software needs to retain
 information about what has been generated, so this is an example where
 a function must have a side effect not observed by the user.
 R frowns upon this sort of thing, but it's necessary in this case.

Random slippage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the exact floating point representations of a random number sequence
 differ, even in the 14th, 15th, 16th decimal places, if you run a simulation
 long enough, such a difference can be enough to change the result of some
 conditional calculation.
 Suppose your code involves:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
> if(x>0) { do one thing } else{ do something different }
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As soon as a small difference changes the result of testing 
\emph on
x>0
\emph default
, the remainder of the simulation can change entirely.
 This happened to me in my thesis as a result of the difference of an AMD
 and Intel processor, and took a while to figure out.
 
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
So to be reproducible, we generally need to document the generator used
 and the exact initial state of the generator (generally via the seed).
 You can check the state of the generator after each of two runs, provided
 you have saved the final state, and this is confirmation that the simulation
 is exactly replicable.

\begin_layout Subsection
RNG in parallel
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can generally rely on the RNG in R to give a reasonable set of values.
 One time when we want to think harder is when doing work with RNG in parallel
 on multiple processors.
 The worst thing that could happen is that one sets things up in such a
 way that every process is using the same sequence of random numbers.
 This could happen if you mistakenly set the same seed in each process,
 e.g., using 
\emph on
set.seed(mySeed)
\emph default
 in R on every process.
 More details on parallel RNG are given in the Section 5 of the tutorial

\begin_layout Section
Generating random variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a variety of methods for generating from common distributions
 (normal, gamma, beta, Poisson, t, etc.).
 Since these tend to be built into R and presumably use good algorithms,
 we won't go into them.
 A variety of statistical computing and Monte Carlo books describe the various
 methods.
 Many are built on the relationships between different distributions - e.g.,
 a beta random variable (RV) can be generated from two gamma RVs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also note that you can call the C functions that implement the R distribution
 functions as a library (
\emph on
Rmath
\emph default
), so if you're coding in C or another language, you should be able to make
 use of the standard functions:

 (as well as a variety of other R math functions, which can be seen in

 involved in the pivoted Cholesky.

\end_inset

 For discrete CDFs, one can work with a discretized version.
 For multivariate distributions, one can work with a univariate marginal
 and then a sequence of univariate conditionals:

Rejection sampling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic idea of rejection sampling (RS) relies on the introduction of
 an auxiliary variable, 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $X\sim F$
\end_inset

.
 Then we can write 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=\int_{0}^{f(x)}du$
\end_inset

.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is the marginal density of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 in the joint density, 
\begin_inset Formula $(X,U)\sim\mathcal{U}\{(x,u):0<u<f(x)\}$
\end_inset

.
 Now we'd like to use this in a way that relies only on evaluating 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 without having to draw from 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To implement this we draw from a larger set and then only keep draws for
 which 
\begin_inset Formula $u<f(x)$
\end_inset

.
 We choose a density, 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, that is easy to draw from and that can 
\emph on
majorize
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, which means there exists a constant 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 s.t.
 , 
\begin_inset Formula $cg(x)\geq f(x)$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall x$
\end_inset

.
 In other words we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $cg(x)$
\end_inset

 is an upper envelope for 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

.
 The algorithm is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
generate 
\begin_inset Formula $x\sim g$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
generate 
\begin_inset Formula $u\sim\mathcal{U}(0,1)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
if 
\begin_inset Formula $u\leq f(x)/cg(x)$
\end_inset

 then use 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

; otherwise go back to step 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intuition here is graphical: we generate from under a curve that is
 always above 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 and accept only when 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 puts us under 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 relative to the majorizing density.
 A key here is that the majorizing density have fatter tails than the density
 of interest, so that the constant 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 can exist.
 So we could use a 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to generate from a normal but not the reverse.
 We'd like 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 to be small to reduce the number of rejections because it turns out that
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{c}=\frac{\int f(x)dx}{\int cg(x)dx}$
\end_inset

 is the acceptance probability.
 This approach works in principle for multivariate densities but as the
 dimension increases, the proportion of rejections grows, because more of
 the volume under 
\begin_inset Formula $cg(x)$
\end_inset

 is above 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is costly to evaluate, we can sometimes reduce calculation using a lower
 bound on 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 In this case we accept if 
\begin_inset Formula $u\leq f_{\mbox{low}}(y)/cg_{Y}(y)$
\end_inset

.
 If it is not, then we need to evaluate the ratio in the usual rejection
 sampling algorithm.
 This is called squeezing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One example of RS is to sample from a truncated normal.
 Of course we can just sample from the normal and then reject, but this
 can be inefficient, particularly if the truncation is far in the tail (a
 case in which inverse CDF suffers from numerical difficulties).
 Suppose the truncation point is greater than zero.
 Working with the standardized version of the normal, you can use an translated
 exponential with lower end point equal to the truncation point as the majorizin
g density (Robert 1995; Statistics and Computing, and see calculations in
 the demo code).
 For truncation less than zero, just make the values negative.

Adaptive rejection sampling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The difficulty of RS is finding a good enveloping function.
 Adaptive rejection sampling refines the envelope as the draws occur, in
 the case of a continuous, differentiable, log-concave density.
 The basic idea considers the log of the density and involves using tangents
 or secants to define an upper envelope and secants to define a lower envelope
 for a set of points in the support of the distribution.
 The result is that we have piecewise exponentials (since we are exponentiating
 from straight lines on the log scale) as the bounds.
 We can sample from the upper envelope based on sampling from a discrete
 distribution and then the appropriate exponential.
 The lower envelope is used for squeezing.
 We add points to the set that defines the envelopes whenever we accept
 a point that requires us to evaluate 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 (the points that are accepted based on squeezing are not added to the set).
 We'll talk this through some in class.

\begin_layout Subsection
Importance sampling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Importance sampling (IS) allows us to estimate expected values, with some
 commonalities with rejection sampling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\phi=E_{f}(h(X))=\int h(x)\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}g(x)dx
\]

\end_inset

so 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\phi}=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i}h(x_{i})\frac{f(x_{i})}{g(x_{i})}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 drawn from 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}^{*}=f(x_{i})/g(x_{i})$
\end_inset

 act as weights.
 Often in Bayesian contexts, we know 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 only up to a normalizing constant.
 In this case we need to use 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=w_{i}^{*}/\sum_{i}w_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we don't require the majorizing property, just that the densities have
 common support, but things can be badly behaved if we sample from a density
 with lighter tails than the density of interest.
 So in general we want 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 to have heavier tails.
 More specifically for a low variance estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, we would want that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x_{i})/g(x_{i})$
\end_inset

 is large only when 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x_{i})$
\end_inset

 is very small, to avoid having overly influential points.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This suggests we can reduce variance in an IS context by oversampling 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x)$
\end_inset

 is large and undersampling when it is small, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Var}(\hat{\phi})=\frac{1}{m}\mbox{Var}(h(X)\frac{f(X)}{g(X)})$
\end_inset

.
 An example is that if 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is an indicator function that is 1 only for rare events, we should oversample
 rare events and then the IS estimator corrects for the oversampling.

A measure of the effective sample size (ESS) is 
\begin_inset Formula $m/(1+\hat{cv}^{2}(w))$
\end_inset

 where we take the square of coefficient of variation of the weights.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What if we actually want a sample from 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 as opposed to estimating the expected value above? We can draw 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 from the unweighted sample, 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x_{i}\}$
\end_inset

, with weights 
\begin_inset Formula $\{w_{i}\}$
\end_inset

.
 This is called sampling importance resampling (SIR).

If 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 are uniform in 
\begin_inset Formula $C=\{(u,v):\,0\leq u\leq\sqrt{f(v/u)}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $X=V/U$
\end_inset

 has density proportion to 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 The basic algorithm is to choose a rectangle that encloses 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 and sample until we find 
\begin_inset Formula $u\leq f(v/u)$
\end_inset

.
 Then we use 
\begin_inset Formula $x=v/u$
\end_inset

 as our RV.
 The larger region enclosing 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is the majorizing region and a simple approach (if 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{2}f(x)$
\end_inset

 are bounded in 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

) is to choose the rectangle, 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq u\leq\sup_{x}\sqrt{f(x)}$

\begin_inset Formula $\inf_{x}x\sqrt{f(x)}\leq v\leq\sup_{x}x\sqrt{f(x)}$
