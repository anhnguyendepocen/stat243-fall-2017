You have several options for UNIX command-line access. You'll need to choose one of these and get it working.

Mac OS:

Open a Terminal by going to Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal

Windows:

1.  You may be able to use the Ubuntu bash shell available in Windows.

Your PC must be running a 64-bit version of Windows 10 Anniversary Update or later (build 1607+).

Please see this link for more information:

2. You could also try using the BCE virtual machine, which is a virtual Linux machine that you can use on your own computer through a program called VirtualBox. You're welcome to try this, though we haven't updated the BCE virtual machine in a while. Please see bce.berkeley.edu.

3. There's an older program called cygwin that provides a UNIX command-line interface. 

Linux:

You may have access to a Linux machine in various ways.

1. You may have your own machine or access to a Linux server.

2. With an SCF account (please get an account form from Chris), you can login to our various Linux servers and access a bash shell that way. Please see http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/access.

3. With an SCF account, you can also access a bash shell via the SCF Jupyterhub interface; please see the JupyterLogin.txt instructions.
