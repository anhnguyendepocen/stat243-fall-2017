Unless otherwise noted, all assignments should be completed by the
time of class, 2 pm. For problem sets, submission
is due at the start of class as a paper submission and via Github.
Instructions for other assignments will vary.

Unless otherwise noted, tutorials are found at
statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/training/tutorials.

Friday, Aug. 25 by 2 pm:

1) fill out the class survey: https://goo.gl/forms/3hcV95EgXw2uvZAv2
This is required and due by Friday (and will be counted as one of the questions on the first problem set).

2) get access to a bash shell and work through the UNIX basics tutorial. If you'd like to use the shell, git, and R on your own machine,
try to set that up too.

If you have problems with software installation, UNIX access, or would like to discuss material from the UNIX basics tutorial, please attend the optional
Friday session on UNIX and installation.
Session will be 3 pm - 5 pm in Evans 342.

Monday, Aug. 28 by 2 pm:

Work through the tutorial on using bash and hand in 
(at the beginning of class) a paper solution to questions 1-10 posed 
at the end of the tutorial. See comments in unit2-bash.pdf on what sections you can skip or skim over.

This is not a formal problem set, so your answers can be in any format
and can simply be the code you would use to solve the problem without any textual explanation. Hand-written is fine too. 

Week of Aug. 28:

If you are not familiar with R at the level of
modules 1-6 of the R bootcamp
(https://github.com/berkeley-scf/r-bootcamp-2017/archive/master.zip), work through those
modules and the breakout problems associated with the modules and
(optionally) attend the special catch-up session on R to be held
during the week. Some other resources for R are listed at the end of module 11
of the bootcamp materials, so you could also use those resources. 

Week of Sep. 4 (date TBD):

first problem set (PS1) due.
